	  		<h3> Naruto</h3>
	  		<p> Naruto is my favorite anime. I discovered it when i was in middle school and it quite changed my life because this anime is a real life lesson. Through the main character, I learned the power of friendship and undestood some important aspects of life. I recommand anyone to start watchign or reading it, it might be frightening because it is very long, but it is worth it.  </p>
